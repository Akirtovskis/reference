# The Clarity Language Reference

This repository is the primary reference for the Clarity language.

Note that this reference is not normative. It may include details that are specific to the Stacks blockchain implementation of Clarity itself, and should not be taken as a specification for the Clarity language. Such a specification may come someday, but this is what we have for now.

You can read [the language reference](https://github.com/clarity-lang/reference/blob/master/reference.md).
